# Type Error: Passing Array to Function Expecting String

This code demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript that occurs when passing an array to a function that expects a string argument.  The `greeter` function is defined to accept a string and return a greeting. However, an array is passed as an argument, causing a type error. The solution demonstrates how to correctly handle this situation by ensuring the function receives the expected type of argument.
